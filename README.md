 # The Generative World Explorer üåç

This idea maps almost perfectly to every single one of your requirements.

    The Concept: A procedurally generated world (like a map in Minecraft or Civilization) that is "discovered" as you pan and zoom. The world doesn't exist until you look at it.

    How it Fits the Challenges:

        10,000x10,000 Grid: This is your world map. Each cell is a tile of terrain.

        Expensive Cell Creation: This is the core mechanic! To determine what a cell is (e.g., water, grass, mountain, forest), you run a procedural generation algorithm like Perlin or Simplex noise based on the cell's (x, y) coordinates. This is a genuinely computationally expensive task, making your caching strategy meaningful.

        New vs. Cached Cells: This translates perfectly to a "Fog of War" mechanic.

            New (Blue): Undiscovered cells. You can render them as blue water or a dark fog.

            Cached (Yellow/Terrain Color): When a cell scrolls into view for the first time, you run your generation algorithm, "discover" it, and store its terrain type in your cache. From then on, it's rendered with its true color (green for grass, brown for mountains, etc.).

        Zoom & Pan: This is how the user explores your infinite world.

    Fun Features to Add:

        Implement different biomes (desert, tundra, forest) based on the noise value.

        At different zoom levels, show different levels of detail. Zoomed out, you see biomes. Zoomed in, you see individual trees or villages.

        Add a "seed" input so you can generate different worlds.
## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:
